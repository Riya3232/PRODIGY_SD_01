# PRODIGY_SD_01
Task 1 - Temperature Conversion Program (Console + GUI) for Prodigy Infotech Internship
# PRODIGY_SD_01 - Temperature Converter 

The task was to build a "Temperature Converter Application" in Java that can convert temperatures between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.  
The program takes a temperature input from the user along with its unit and then converts it into the other two units.  

To make the application user-friendly, the project includes both:  
- A **Console-based program**  
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using **Java Swing**

## üéØ Features
- Converts temperature between "Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin" 
- User can select the input unit (C/F/K)  
- Automatically converts into the other two units  
- Provides results in "both console and GUI formats"  
- GUI is built using **Java Swing** for a better user experience  
- Input validation included  

## üñ•Ô∏è How It Works
1. User enters a temperature value.  
2. User selects the temperature unit (**Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin**).  
3. Program calculates and displays the converted values in:  
   - **Console output**  
   - **GUI Window**
   - 
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8 or higher)
- Java Swing(for GUI)  
- Scanner Class(for console input)
